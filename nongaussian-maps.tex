\section{CMB Maps from Generalised Local NonGaussianity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Description of the form of nonGaussianity produced by these models.
\item Description of how to do marginalisation from coarse-grained distribution (ie. smoothed over a Hubble at the end of inflation) to pixels in CMB of LSS
\item T and E maps from generalised local nonGaussianity
\end{itemize}
