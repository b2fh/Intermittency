\section{Dynamics of Trajectories in Phase Space and Caustics}
Several regimes to consider
\begin{itemize}
\item Classical motion with stochastic noise term.  Occurs while inflating and subhorizon modes cross the horizon.
\item This stage generates the isocurvature mode that allows for the chaotic motion to be realised
\item Classical decoupled trajectories with no noise term.  After inflation ends, but before onset of strong inhomogeneities from preheating.
\item Post-inflation can extend the decoupled trajectories approximation into the subhorizon regime, in the limit that the zero mode is unstable (and continuity for k small, so those modes are also unstable)
\item Fully mode-mode coupled inhomogeneous evolution.
\end{itemize}
