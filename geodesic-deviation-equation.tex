\section{Derivation of GDE}
Consider the equations of motion for a phase space vector given by
\begin{equation}
  \dot{v} = H(v)
\end{equation}
where we have assumed that the dynamics is autonomous. {\bf We could remove zeta as a dependent variable and make it non-autonomous?  Then we have the view of carrying zeta around with us}
Our goal is to determine the motion of deviation vectors in phase space defined by
\begin{equation}
  \delta(t|v_0) = v(t|x_0+\delta) - v(t|x_0) \, .
\end{equation}
We work in the limit of infinitesimal initial perturbations, so that we can linearize the equations for $\delta$.
We have
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\delta} = \dot{v}(t|v_0+\delta) - \dot{v}(t|v_0) = \mathcal{H}(v(t|v_0+\delta)) - \mathcal{H}(v(t|v_0))
\end{equation}
Since we assume an infinitesimal perturbation, we have $v(t|v_0+\delta) = v(t|v_0) + \delta(t|v_0)$ and we can expand $\mathcal{H}$
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\delta} = \frac{\partial\mathcal{H}}{\partial v_0}
\end{equation}
