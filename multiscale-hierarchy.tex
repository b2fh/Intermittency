\section{Multiscale Hierarchies and Generation of Modulation Parameters}
Outline the basic scales in the problem and indicate that we have a multiple hierarchies to consider.  Also explain how we will basically view each spatial position as some individual ballistic trajectory.  This generalises the philosophy behind the separate universe approximation.  When going from the smaller length scales back up to larger length scales in the hierarchy, convolutions must be done.  This allows for entropy generation via coarse-graining.  The complicated motion of the trajectories then allows for the coarse-graining to in some sense operate very differently in different spatial locations.  This leads to $\zeta$ perturbations and a relationship to entropy production.  To recover the results for the CMB, we must then smooth the fine-grained distribution associated with $\bar{\chi}$ smoothed over a Hubble patch at the end of inflation, back up to a scale associated with the size of a CMB pixel.
